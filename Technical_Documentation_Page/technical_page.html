                                <p>Ruby is a simple and powerful object-oriented programming language, created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (who goes by the
                                handle “Matz” in this document and on the mailing lists).</p>
                                <p>Like Perl, Ruby is good at text processing. Like Smalltalk, everything in Ruby is an object, and Ruby has blocks,
                                iterators, meta-classes and other good stuff.</p>
                                <p>You can use Ruby to write servers, experiment with prototypes, and for everyday programming tasks. As a fully-integrated
                                object-oriented language, Ruby scales well.</p>

                                <p>Let’s define a class called <code>Person</code>, with a name and an age. We’ll test our code by creating a few people and examining
                                them.</p>
                                <code class="block">
class Person 
  attr_accessor :name, :age 
 def initialize(name, age)
  @name = name 
  @age = age.to_i 
 end 
 def inspect 
 "#{name} (#{age})" 
 end 
end 
p1 = Person.new("Elmo", 4) 
p2 = Person.new("Zoe", 7) 
p1 # => Elmo (4) 
p2 # => Zoe (7)
                                </code>
                                <p>Now let’s populate an array of people by reading their names and ages from a file ages containing lines like:</p>
                                <code class="block">
Bert: 8 
Cookie: 11 
Elmo: 4 
Ernie: 8 
Zoe: 7
                                </code>
                                <p>The code uses regular expressions to parse successive lines from the input file, creating a new <code>Person</code> object for each
                                match and pushing it onto the end of the array <code>people</code>.</p>
                                <code class="block">
people = Array.new 
File.foreach("ages") do |line| 
  people << Person.new($1, $2) if line=~ /(.*):\s+(\d+)/ 
end 
people #=> [Bert (8), Cookie (11), Elmo (4), Ernie (8), Zoe (7)]   
                                </code>
                                <p>Now, let’s sort the result based on the person’s age. There are many ways to do this. We can define a sort block, which
                                tells Ruby how to do the comparison of two people:</p>
                                <code class="block">
sorted = people.sort {|a, b| a.age <=> b.age } 
sorted # => [Elmo (4), Zoe (7), Bert (8), Ernie (8), Cookie (11)]  
                                </code>
                                <p>Another way would be to change the comparison method for class <code>Person</code>:</p>
                                <code class="block">
class Person 
    def <=>(other) 
        age <=> other.age 
    end 
end 
people.sort # => [Elmo (4), Zoe (7), Bert (8), Ernie (8), Cookie (11)]  
                            </code>

                                <h4>Does assignment generate a new copy of an object?</h4>
                                <p>All variables and constants reference (point at) some object. (With the exception of uninitialized local variables,
                                which reference nothing. These raise a <code>NameError</code>exception if used). When you assign to a variable, or initialize a constant, you set the object that the variable or
                                constant references.</p>
                                <p>Assignment on its own therefore never creates a new copy of an object.</p>
                                <p>There’s a slightly deeper explanation in certain special cases. Instances of <code>Fixnum</code>,<code>NilClass</code>,<code>TrueClass</code>, and <code>FalseClass</code>
                                are contained directly in variables or constants—there is no reference involved. A variable holding the number <code>42</code>or the constant<code>true</code>actually holds the value, and not a reference to it. Assignment therefore physically produces a copy of objects of these
                                types.</p>
                            <h4>What is the scope of a local variable?</h4>
                            <p>A new scope for a local variable is introduced in (1) the toplevel (main), (2) a class (or module) definition, or (3) a
                            method definition.</p>
                            <code class="block">
var = 1 # (1) 
class Demo 
    var = 2 # (2) 
    def method 
        var = 3 # (3) 
        puts "in method: var = #{var}" 
    end 
    puts "in class: var = #{var}" 
end 
puts "at top level: var = #{var}" 
Demo.new.method
                            </code>
                            <p>Produces:</p>
                            <code class="block">
in class: var = 2 
at top level: var = 1 
in method: var = 3
                            </code>
                            <p>(Note that the class definition is executable code: the trace message it contains is written as the class is defined).</p>
                            <p>A block (<code>{ ... }</code> or <code>do ... end</code>) almost introduces a new scope ;-) Local variables created within a block are not
                            accessible outside the block. However, if a local variable within the block has the same name as an existing local
                            variable in the caller’s scope, then no new local variable is created, and you can subsequently access that variable
                            outside the block.</p>
                            <code class="block">
a = 0 
1.upto(3) do |i| 
    a += i 
    b = i*i 
end 
a # => 6 
# b is not defined here
                            </code>
                            <p>This becomes significant when you use threading—each thread receives its own copy of the variables local to the thread’s
                            block:</p>
                            <code class="block">
threads = [] 
["one", "two"].each do |name|
    threads << Thread.new do 
        local_name=name 
        a=0 
        3.times do |i| 
            Thread.pass 
            a +=i 
            puts "#{local_name}: #{a}" 
        end 
    end 
end 
threads.each {|t| t.join }
                            </code>
                            <p>Might produce (in case the scheduler switches threads as hinted by <code>Thread.pass</code>; this depends on OS and processor):</p>
                            <code class="block">
one: 0
two: 0
one: 1
two: 1
one: 3
two: 3
                            </code>
                            <p><code>while</code>, <code>until</code>, and <code>for</code> are control structures, not blocks, so local variables within them will be accessible in the
                            enclosing environment. <code>loop</code>, however, is a method and the associated block introduces a new scope.</p>

                            <section id="Iterators" class="main-section">
                                <header>Iterators</header>
                                <p>An iterator is a method which accepts a block or a <code>Proc</code> object. In the source file, the block is placed immediately
                                after the invocation of the method. Iterators are used to produce user-defined control structures—especially loops.
                                Let’s look at an example to see how this works. Iterators are often used to repeat the same action on each element of a
                                collection, like this:</p>
                                <p>Let’s look at an example to see how this works. Iterators are often used to repeat the same action on each element of a
                                collection, like this:</p>
                                <code class="block">
data = [1, 2, 3] 
data.each do |i| 
    puts i 
end
                                </code>
                                <p>Produces:</p>
                                <code class="block">
1 
2 
3
                                </code>
                                <p>This code has the same meaning as the last example. However, in some cases, precedence issues cause <code>do ... end</code> and <code>{ ... }</code> to act differently.</p>
                                <code class="block">
foobar a, b do ... end # foobar is the iterator. 
foobar a, b { ... } # b is the iterator.
                                </code>
                                <p>This is because <code>{ ... }</code> binds more tightly to the preceding expression than does a <code>do ... end</code> block. The first example
                                is equivalent to <code>foobar(a, b) do ... end</code>, while the second is <code>foobar(a, b { ... })</code>.</p>
                                <h4>How can I pass a block to an iterator?</h4>
                                <p>You simply place the block after the iterator call. You can also pass a <code>Proc</code> object by prepending <code>&</code> to the variable or
                                constant name that refers to the <code>Proc</code>.</p>

                                <h4>What is the difference between an immediate value and a reference?</h4>
                                <p><code>Fixnum</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>nil</code>, and <code>false</code> are implemented as immediate values. With immediate values, variables hold the objects
                                themselves, rather than references to them.</p>
                                <p>Singleton methods cannot be defined for such objects. Two <code>Fixnum</code> of the same value always represent the same object
                                instance, so (for example) instance variables for the <code>Fixnum</code> with the value <code>1</code> are shared between all the <code>1</code>’s in the
                                system. This makes it impossible to define a singleton method for just one of these.</p>
                                <h4>What is the difference between nil and false?</h4>
                                <p>First the similarity: <code>nil</code> and <code>false</code> are the only two objects that evaluate to <code>false</code> in a boolean context. (In other
                                words: they are the only “falsy” values, all other objects are “truthy”.)</p>
                                <p>However, <code>nil</code> and <code>true</code> are instances of different classes (<code>NilClass</code> and <code>FalseClass</code>), and have different behavior
                                elsewhere.</p>
                                <p>We recommend that predicate methods (those whose name ends with a question mark) return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Other methods
                                that need to indicate failure should return <code>nil</code>.</p>
                                <h4>Why is an empty string not false?</h4>
                                <p>Q: An empty string (<code>""</code>) returns <code>true</code> in a conditional expression! In Perl, it’s <code>false</code>.
                                A: But Ruby is not Perl ;-). It’s very simple: in Ruby, only <code>nil</code> and <code>false</code> are false in conditional contexts.
                                You can use <code>empty?</code>, compare the string to <code>""</code>, or compare the string’s <code>size</code> or <code>length</code> to <code>0</code> to find out if a string is
                                empty.</p>
                                <h4>What does :name mean?</h4>
                                <p>A colon followed by a name generates a Symbol object which corresponds one to one with the identifier. During the
                                duration of a program’s execution the same Symbol object will be created for a given name or string. Symbols can also be
                                created with <code>"name".intern</code> or <code>"name".to_sym</code>.</p>
                                <p>Symbol objects can represent identifiers for methods, variables, and so on. Some methods, like <code>define_method</code>,
                                <code>method_missing</code>, or <code>trace_var</code>, require a symbol. Other methods, e.g. <code>attr_accessor</code>, <code>send</code>, or <code>autoload</code>, also accept a
                                string.</p>
                                <p>Due to the fact that they are created only once, Symbols are often used as hash keys. String hash keys would create a
                                new object for every single use, thereby causing some memory overhead. There is even a special syntax for symbol hash
                                keys:</p>
                                <code class="block">
person_1 = { :name => "John", :age => 42 } 
person_2 = { name: "Jane", age: 24 } # alternate syntax
                                </code>
                                <p>Symbols can also be used as enumeration values or to assign unique values to constants:</p>
                                <code class="block">
status = :open # :closed, ... 
NORTH = :NORTH 
SOUTH = :SOUTH
                            </code>

                                <p>Ruby binds all messages to methods dynamically. It searches first for singleton methods in the receiver, then for
                                methods defined in the receiver’s own class, and finally for methods defined in the receiver’s superclasses (including
                                any modules which may have been mixed in). You can see the order of searching by displaying <code>ClassName.ancestors</code>, which
                                shows the ancestor classes and modules of <code>ClassName</code>.</p>
                                <p>If after searching the alternatives a matching method could not be found, Ruby tries to invoke a method called
                                <code>method_missing</code>, repeating the same search procedure to find it. This allows you to handle messages to unknown methods,
                                and is often used to provide dynamic interfaces to classes.</p>
                                <code class="block">
module Emphasizable 
    def emphasize 
        "**#{self}**" 
    end 
end 
class String 
    include Emphasizable 
end
String.ancestors
    # => [String, Emphasizable, Comparable, Object, Kernel, 
    BasicObject] 

"Wow!".emphasize # => "**Wow!**"
                                </code>
                                <p>When the method <code>emphasize</code> is searched for, it is not found in class <code>String</code>, so Ruby searches next in the module
                                <code>Emphasizable</code>.</p>
                                <p>In order to override a method that already exists in the receiver’s class, e.g. <code>String#capitalize</code>, you need to insert
                                the module into the ancestor chain in front of that class, by using <code>prepend</code>:</p>
                                <code class="block">
module PrettyCapitalize 
    def capitalize 
        "**#{super}**" 
    end 
end 
class String 
    prepend PrettyCapitalize 
end 
String.ancestors
    # => [PrettyCapitalize, String, Comparable, Object, Kernel, 
    BasicObject] 

"hello".capitalize # => "**Hello**"
                                </code>

                                <h4>Can a class definition be repeated?</h4>
                                <p>A class can be defined repeatedly. Each definition is added to the last definition. If a method is redefined, the former
                                one is overridden and lost.</p>
                                <h4>What is a class instance variable?Are there class variables?</h4>
                                <p>There are. A variable prefixed with two at signs <code>(@@)</code> (@@) is a class variable, accessible within both instance and class
                                methods of the class.</p>

                                <p>However, you probably should use class instance variables instead.</p>
                                <h4>What is a class instance variable?</h4>
                                <p>Here the example of the previous section rewritten using a class instance variable:</p>
                                <code class="block">
class Entity 

    @instances = 0 
    
    class << self 
        attr_accessor :instances # provide class methods for 
        reading/writing 
    end 
    def initialize 
        self.class.instances +=1 
        @number=self.class.instances 
    end 
    def who_am_i 
        "I'm #{@number} of #{self.class.instances}"
    end 
    def self.total 
        @instances 
    end 
end 
entities=Array.new(9) { Entity.new } 
entities[6].who_am_i #=> "I'm 7 of 9" 
Entity.instances # => 9 
Entity.total # => 9
                                </code>
                                <p>Here, <code>@instances</code> is a class instance variable. It does not belong to an instance of class <code>Entity</code>, but to the class
                                object <code>Entity</code>, which is an instance of class <code>Class</code>.
                                Class instance variables are directly accessible only within class methods of the class.</p>
                                <h4>What is the difference between class variables and class instance variables?</h4>
                                <p>The main difference is the behavior concerning inheritance: class variables are shared between a class and all its
                                subclasses, while class instance variables only belong to one specific class.</p>
                                <p>Class variables in some way can be seen as global variables within the context of an inheritance hierarchy, with all the
                                problems that come with global variables. For instance, a class variable might (accidentally) be reassigned by any of
                                its subclasses, affecting all other classes:</p>
                                <code class="block">
class Woof 

    @@sound = "woof" 
    
    def self.sound 
        @@sound 
    end 

end 
Woof.sound # => "woof" 

class LoudWoof < Woof 
    @@sound="WOOF" 
end 

LoudWoof.sound #=> "WOOF" 
Woof.sound # => "WOOF" (!)
                                </code>
                                <p>Or, an ancestor class might later be reopened and changed, with possibly surprising effects:</p>
                                <code class="block">
class Foo 

    @@var = "foo" 
    
    def self.var 
        @@var 
    end 
    
end 
Foo.var # => "foo" (as expected) 

class Object 
    @@var = "object" 
end 
Foo.var # => "object" (!)
                                </code>
                                <p>So, unless you exactly know what you are doing and explicitly need this kind of behavior, you better should use class
                                instance variables.</p>
